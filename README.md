# jsTicTacToe
This was the TicTacToe project from The Odin Project's Javascript course.
I was supposed to use factory functions when I needed multiples, and modules when I needed just one of something,
however after I set up the project HTML and CSS I found that all I needed was a couple of event listeners.
Maybe I was supposed to set up the elements using JS rather than HTML, 
but in any case I feel like I'm making decent progress and definitely starting to feel more comfortable with my coding.
